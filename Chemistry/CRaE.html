            Types of Changes in Matter:
        </h2>
        <h3>
            1. Physical Change
        </h3>
        <p>
          During this change, a substance changes its physical state without changing its chemical composition.       </p>
        <p>
            In physical change, we do not get a new substance with new chemical nature.
        </p>
        <p class="examples"><!--Equation -->
            Example: 
            <div class="eq-c">
                <span>H<sub>2</sub>O (l)<sub></sub> 
                  <span class="heat-arrow">
                    <span class="heat-symbol">&Delta;</span>
                    <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span>
                  </span> 
                  H<sub>2</sub>O (g)
                </span>
            </div>
        </p>
        <h3>2. Chemical Change</h3>
        <p>
          During this change, a substance reacts with another and changes its chemical properties or composition.

        </p>
        <p>Chemical change brings change in physical as well as chemical properties of a subatance.</p>
        
        <p class="examples"><!--Equation -->
            Example: 
            <div class="eq-c">
                <span>2H<sub>2</sub>+ O <sub>2</sub><span>(g)</span> 
                  <span class="heat-arrow">
                    
                    <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span>
                  </span> 
                  H<sub>2</sub>O (l)
                </span>
            </div>
        </p>
        <h3>Observations that determine a chemical change:</h3>
        <h3> 1. Change in State:</h3>
        <p>For example, hydrogen and oxygen are both gases, but when they combine in a fixed proportion by weight, they form water, which is a liquid.</p>
        <p class="examples"><!--Equation -->
             
            <div class="eq-c">
                <span>2H<sub>2</sub>+ O <sub>2</sub><span>(g)</span> 
                  <span class="heat-arrow">
                    
                    <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span>
                  </span> 
                  H<sub>2</sub>O (l)
                </span>
            </div>
        </p>
        <h3>2. Formation of Percipitate:</h3>
        <p>For example, when potassium iodide reacts with lead nitrate, a yellow precipitate of lead iodide is formed.</p>
        <p class="examples"><!--Equation -->
             
            <div class="eq-c">
                <span>2KI(aq)+ Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><span>(aq)</span> 
                  <span class="heat-arrow">
                    
                    <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span>
                  </span> 
                  2KNO<sub>3</sub>(aq) + PbI<sub>2</sub> &darr;
                </span>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>Potassium Iodide + Lead Nitrate &rarr; Potassium Nitrate + Lead Iodide (Yellow Ppt)</p>
        <p>Silver ornaments when exposed to air for a long time , develops a black coating over them (Change in Color).</p>
        <h3>3. Evolution of Gas:</h3>
        <p>For example, the chemical reaction between zinc and dilute sulfuric acid produces hydrogen gas.</p>
        <p class="examples"><!--Equation -->
             
            <div class="eq-c">
                <span>Zn(s)+ H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub><span>(aq)</span> 
                  <span class="heat-arrow">
                    
                    <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span>
                  </span> 
                  ZnSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub> &uarr;
                </span>
            </div>
        </p>
        <h3>4. Change in Temperature:</h3>
        <p>For example, calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and releases a large amount of heat.</p>
        <p class="examples"><!--Equation -->
             
            <div class="eq-c">
                <span>CaO (s)+ H<sub>2</sub>O<span> (l)</span> 
                  <span class="heat-arrow">
                    
                    <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span>

                </span>
            </div>
        </p>
        <h3>5. Change in Color</h3>
        <p>For example, when iron reacts with copper sulfate solution, the color changes from blue to green.</p>
        <p class="examples"><!--Equation -->
             
            <div class="eq-c">

        <h2>Chemical Equations:</h2>
        <p>A chemical equation is a schematic representation of any chemical reaction using the symbols and formulas of the reactants and products.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The reactants are written on the left-hand side (LHS) with a plus sign between them. </p>
        <p>Similarly, the products are written on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign between them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The arrowhead points towards the products and shows the direction of the reaction. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Reactant &rarr; Product</p>
        <h3>Essentials of Chemical Equations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>It should represent a true chemical change </strong> meaning the reaction should be possible to carry out as represented by the equation.</li>
            <br>
            
            <li><strong>It should be balanced</strong> meaning the number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation should be equal.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>It should be molecular</strong>i.e., the elementary substances like Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc., should be represented as: H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub>, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps for Writing a Chemical Equation:</h2>
        <p>Generally there are three steps to write a chemical equation:</p>
        <h4>Step 1:</h4>
        <p>Writing <strong>basic chemical equation:</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>A skeletal equation just lists the chemicals involved in a reaction by their formulas. It might not make sure everything balances.</p>
        <p>Like:</p>
        <p>Calcium Carbonate &rarr; Calcium Oxide + Carbon Dioxide</p>
        <p class="examples"><!--Equation -->
             
            <div class="eq-c">
                <span>CaCO<sub>3</sub><span></span> 
                  <span class="heat-arrow">
                    
                    <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span>
                  </span> 
                  CaO + CO<sub>2</sub>
                </span>
            </div>
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2:</h4>
        <p>Writing <strong>proper chemical equation:</strong></p>
        <p> It shows all the essential properties of a chemical equation:
            <ul>
                <li>The physical states of the reactants and products are represented as follows: (s) for solid, (l) for liquid, (g) for gas, and (aq) for aqueous.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The specific conditions necessary for the chemical reactions.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The representation of precipitate formation is typically indicated by (&darr;) and (&uarr;) respectively.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Sometimes reaction conditions like temperature, pressure, darkness, catalyst, or light are represented above or below the arrow in a chemical equation like:</li>
                <br> 
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="examples"><!--Equation -->
            Example: 
            <div class="eq-c">
                <span>CaCO<sub>3</sub> 
                  <span class="heat-arrow">
                    <span class="heat-symbol">&Delta;</span>
                    <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span>
                  </span> 
                  CaO (s) + CO<sub>2</sub> (g)
                </span>
                <span>.......(&Delta; represents heat)</span>
            </div>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="examples"><!--Equation -->
            Example: 
            <div class="eq-c">
                <span>CO (g) + 2H<sub>2</sub> (g) 
                  <span class="heat-arrow">
                    <span class="heat-symbol1">340 atm</span>
                    <span class="arrow">&rarr;</span>
                  </span> 
                  CH<sub>3</sub>OH (l)
                </span>
                
            </div>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The change in the energy content before and after the reaction can be represented in a chemical equation as:</p>
        <p>
            A + B &rarr; C + Energy (For exothermic reaction i.e energy is released)
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3:</h4>
        <p>Writing <strong>balanced chemical equation:</strong></p>
        
        <p>It includes the equalisation of atoms of both sides of the equations according to the <strong>"Law of conservation of mass "</strong>, which states that the "mass can neither be created nor be destroyed".</p>

            Balancing of Chemical Equations:
        </h2>
        <p>Balancing of chemical equations is important to show the proper chemical change</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Balancing of Simple Chemical Equations: </strong>The simple equations can be balanced by hit and trial method. </p>
        <p>The steps followed while balancing a chemical equation are given below.</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><Strong>Step 1 : </Strong>Write a skeletal equation with just one molecule of each reactant and product.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Step 2 :</strong>Begin with the compound that has the most atoms or the greatest variety of atoms, and balance the atoms in that compound first. This compound may be either a reactant or a product.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Step 3 : </strong>Balance the elements that appear only once on each side of the arrow first. Then balance the elements that appear more than once.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Step 4 : </strong>Elementary substances are balanced at the end.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Step 5 : </strong>If needed, the entire equation can be multiplied by a suitable number to ensure that all coefficients are whole numbers, but the formulas of the substances cannot be changed to balance the equation.</li>
