        <h3>
            Object
        </h3>
        <p>
            Anything which gives out light either by itself or after reflection from it is said to be an object.
            For example: a candle, tubelight,etc.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Point Object
        </h3>
        <p>
            A very small object likr pin head is a point object and is represented by a dot (.)
        </p>
        <h3>
            Extended Object
        </h3>
        <p>
            Large object like car, bus, candle etc. are called extended objects and are represented by an arrow.( &uarr;)
        </p>
        <h3>
            Image
        </h3>
        <p>
            An image may be defined as that point, where the light rays coming from an object meet or appears to meet after reflection
            There are two types of images i.e: real image and virtual image.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Real Image
        </h3>
        <p>
            Real image is an image formed by the actual inersection of light rays.<p> It can be obtained on the screen.
            </p><p> eg:- The image formed on cinema screen</p>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Virtual Image
        </h3>
        <p>
            If the rays of light responsible for an image formation do not intersect actually but appears to meet at some point, then the image is called virtual image.
            <p> It cannot be obtained on the screen.</p>
            <p>eg:- The image formed by a plane mirror.</p>

            Plane Mirror
        </h3>
        <p>
            A plane glass sheet having a thin layer of silver metal deposited on one side which is protected by a coat of red paint. The light is reflected from silvered surface of the plane mirror.

            Regular Reflection
        </h2>
        <p>
            When all prallel rays of light falls on reflected from a plane smooth surface are prallel, the reflection is known as Regular Reflection. It helps in the formation of image and hence we can see our face in mirror.

            Diffused or Irregular Reflection

        <p>
            When all prallel rays reflected from a rough or uneven surfaces are not prallel, the reflection is known as Diffused or Irregular Reflection. Diffused Reflection does not give rise to image formation.
