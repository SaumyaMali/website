            Incident Ray
        </h3>
        <p>
            The ray of light which strikes any surface is called the Incident Ray.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Reflected Ray
        </h3>
        <p>
            The ray of light which is bounced back by any reflecting surface is called the Reflected Ray
        </p>
        <h3>
            Point of Incidence
        </h3>
        <p>
            It is the point at which the Incident Ray falls on the reflecting surface
        </p>
        <h3>
            Normal
        </h3>
        <p>
            It is the line drawn perpendicular to the reflecting surface at the Point of Incidence
        </p>
        <h3>
            Angle of Incidence
        </h3>
        <p>
            The angle made by the Incident Ray with the Normal at the Point of Incidence.
            It is represented by i
        </p>
        <h3>
            Angle of Reflection
        </h3>
        <p>
            Angle made by the Reflected ray with the Normal at the Point of Incidence.
            It is represented by r
