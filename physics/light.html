        <h3>
            Incident Ray
        </h3>
        <p>
            The ray of light which strikes any surface is called the Incident Ray.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Reflected Ray
        </h3>
        <p>
            The ray of light which is bounced back by any reflecting surface is called the Reflected Ray
        </p>
        <h3>
            Point of Incidence
        </h3>
        <p>
            It is the point at which the Incident Ray falls on the reflecting surface
        </p>
        <h3>
            Normal
        </h3>
        <p>
            It is the line drawn perpendicular to the reflecting surface at the Point of Incidence
        </p>
        <h3>
            Angle of Incidence
        </h3>
        <p>
            The angle made by the Incident Ray with the Normal at the Point of Incidence.
            It is represented by i
        </p>
        <h3>
            Angle of Reflection
        </h3>
        <p>
            Angle made by the Reflected ray with the Normal at the Point of Incidence.
            It is represented by r

        <p>The Reflection Of Light</p>
        <h3>
            Object
        </h3>
        <p>
            Anything which gives out light either by itself or after reflection from it is said to be an object.
            For example: a candle, tubelight,etc.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Point Object
        </h3>
        <p>
            A very small object likr pin head is a point object and is represented by a dot (.)
        </p>
        <h3>
            Extended Object
        </h3>
        <p>
            Large object like car, bus, candle etc. are called extended objects and are represented by an arrow.( &uarr;)
        </p>
        <h3>
            Image
        </h3>
        <p>
            An image may be defined as that point, where the light rays coming from an object meet or appears to meet after reflection
            There are two types of images i.e: real image and virtual image.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Real Image
        </h3>
        <p>
            Real image is an image formed by the actual inersection of light rays.<p> It can be obtained on the screen.
            </p><p> eg:- The image formed on cinema screen</p>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Virtual Image
        </h3>
        <p>
            If the rays of light responsible for an image formation do not intersect actually but appears to meet at some point, then the image is called virtual image.
            <p> It cannot be obtained on the screen.</p>
            <p>eg:- The image formed by a plane mirror.</p>
        </p>

        <h3>
            Plane Mirror
        </h3>
        <p>
            A plane glass sheet having a thin layer of silver metal deposited on one side which is protected by a coat of red paint. The light is reflected from silvered surface of the plane mirror.
