        <h1>Important Definitions:</h1>
        <h3>Incident Ray</h3>
        <p>The ray of light that strikes any surface.</p>
        <h3>Reflected Ray</h3>
        <p>The ray of light that bounces back from a reflecting surface.</p>
        <h3>Point of Incidence</h3>
        <p>The point where the Incident Ray meets the reflecting surface.</p>
        <h3>Normal</h3>
        <p>The line perpendicular to the reflecting surface at the Point of Incidence.</p>
        <h3>Angle of Incidence</h3>
        <p>The angle between the Incident Ray and the Normal at the Point of Incidence.</p>
        <h3>Angle of Reflection</h3>
        <p>The angle between the Reflected Ray and the Normal at the Point of Incidence.</p>

        <p>Reflection Of Light</p>
        <h3>Object</h3>
        <p>Anything emitting light or reflecting light.</p>
        <h3>Point Object</h3>
        <p>A very small object like a pinhead, represented by a dot.</p>
        <h3>Extended Object</h3>
        <p>Large objects like cars or buses, represented by an arrow.</p>
        <h3>Image</h3>
        <p>The point where light rays from an object meet or appear to meet after reflection.</p>
        <h3>Real Image</h3>
        <p>An image formed by the actual intersection of light rays, like on a cinema screen.</p>
        <h3>Virtual Image</h3>
        <p>An image formed when light rays appear to meet but do not actually intersect, like in a plane mirror.</p>

        <h3>Plane Mirror</h3>
        <p>A glass sheet with a thin layer of silver metal, reflecting light.</p>

        <h1>Properties of Light</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>It's a non-mechanical wave, not requiring any medium to travel.</li>
            <li>Wavelength of light ranges from violet (400nm) to red (700nm).</li>
            <li>Speed of light in vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 m/s.</li>
            <li>It's a transverse wave.</li>
            <li>Light always travels in straight lines (Rectilinear Propagation).</li>

        <h1>Propagation of Light</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>In a homogeneous medium, light travels in a straight line (Rectilinear Propagation).</li>
            <li>Light changes its path due to obstacles or change in the medium.</li>

        <h3>Ray of Light</h3>
        <p>A straight path of light.</p>

        <h1>Laws of Reflection</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection.</li>
            <li>Incident ray, reflected ray, and the normal form a plane.</li>

        <h1>Kinds of Reflection:</h1>
        <h2>Regular Reflection</h2>
        <p>When parallel rays of light reflected from a smooth surface are parallel, it's called Regular Reflection. It helps in forming images, like seeing our face in a mirror.</p>
        <img src="regular.png" alt="Regular reflection">
        <h3>Diffused or Irregular Reflection</h3>
        <p>When parallel rays reflected from rough surfaces are not parallel, it's called Diffused or Irregular Reflection. It doesn't form clear images.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Image formed by a plane mirror is virtual.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Image formed by a plane mirror is always erect.</li>

            <li>Size of the image formed by a plane mirror is the same as that of the object.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Distance of the image from a plane mirror is equal to the distance of the object from the mirror.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Image formed by a plane mirror is laterally inverted.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Important Note:</strong> Though every part of a mirror forms a complete image of an object, we usually see only the part where light after reflection from the mirror reaches.</li>
